     * This test was used to debug an issue with Visual Studio / NTVS 
     * test discovery. The test discovery showed a pretty cryptic error message:
     *
     * Test discovery error: [TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined] in P:\BuyCo\BuyCo\test\controllers\testProposalController.js
     *
     * The test below does roughly what the NTVS test discovery does, but
     * /within/ a Mocha test. Running this test from the command line 
     * showed a complete stack trace of the error, which showed the cause,
     * which now has been fixed: in serviceFactory the configuration 
     * couldn't be found when running from within the VS test runner.
